## Introduction (1/2)

<section style="font-size: 26px;">

This guide, written by the Coding Group of the ONDA Lab, is **a humorous collection of bad programming habits**.
While countless guides explain how to write good code, we realized that another way to learn is by looking at what not to do. After all, most of us (certainly we, at least) are naturally prone to becoming bad programmers.

So instead of only focusing on the ‚Äúright‚Äù way, this guide highlights the habits you really shouldn‚Äôt have (but probably already do).

<br>

**Enjoy!**

_P.S. You might think that writing this makes us excellent programmers. The truth? We‚Äôre not, but we‚Äôre trying to unlearn these bad habits!_
